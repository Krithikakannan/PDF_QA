📄 Project Report: PDF Question Answering System (Offline)
1. Project Overview

This project implements a PDF-based Question Answering system that allows users to:

Upload a PDF document

Ask natural language questions about the content

Receive answers generated strictly from the PDF

Run completely offline using a locally hosted LLM

The system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) instead of fine-tuning, making it lightweight, fast to build, and scalable.

2. Why This Project?

Traditional LLMs:

Cannot read custom PDFs directly

Hallucinate answers without grounding

Require internet access

This project solves those problems by:

Extracting text from PDFs

Converting text into vector embeddings

Retrieving only relevant content

Passing that content to a local LLM for accurate answers

3. What We Built (High-Level)
Core Components:

PDF Text Extraction

Text Chunking

Vector Embeddings

Vector Database (ChromaDB)

Local LLM Inference (Ollama + LLaMA3)

Command-Line Q&A

Web UI using Streamlit

4. Architecture (How It Works)
PDF → Text Extraction → Chunking
     → Embeddings → ChromaDB (Vector Store)
User Question → Embedding → Similarity Search
              → Relevant Context
              → LLaMA 3 (Ollama)
              → Final Answer


This is a classic RAG pipeline.

5. File-by-File Explanation
🔹 extract_pdf.py
Purpose

Reads a PDF file

Splits text into overlapping chunks

Generates embeddings

Stores them in ChromaDB

Why It Exists

Separates data preparation from querying

Allows preprocessing once and reuse later

What It Does

Uses PyMuPDF (fitz) to extract text

Uses SentenceTransformers to create embeddings

Stores vectors persistently in chroma_db

🔹 ask_pdf.py
Purpose

Command-line interface to ask questions from the PDF

Why It Exists

Simple, minimal testing tool

Useful for debugging retrieval and LLM responses

What It Does

Loads stored embeddings

Converts user query into a vector

Retrieves top relevant chunks

Sends context + question to LLaMA3 via Ollama

Prints the answer

🔹 app.py (Streamlit UI)
Purpose

Provides a user-friendly web interface

Why It Exists

Non-technical users can interact easily

Enables PDF upload + live Q&A

What It Does

Uploads PDF through UI

Extracts and embeds text dynamically

Clears old vectors before storing new ones

Accepts user questions

Retrieves relevant chunks

Displays LLM-generated answers

6. Technologies Used

7. Key Design Decisions
✅ Why RAG instead of Fine-Tuning?

Faster to build

No training cost

Works with any PDF

Easily updatable

✅ Why Local LLM (Ollama)?

Fully offline

No API cost

Data privacy

Works without internet

8. Current Capabilities

✅ Offline execution

✅ Accurate, context-grounded answers

✅ Supports any PDF

✅ CLI + Web UI

✅ Persistent vector storage

9. Limitations (Current Version)

No user authentication

No chat history

No voice input

No multi-PDF support

Single-user setup

(These were intentionally not added to keep the project stable and simple.)

10. Possible Future Improvements

Chat history memory

Voice input (speech-to-text)

Multi-PDF support

Login & user sessions

Mobile-friendly frontend

Cloud deployment

Hybrid search (keyword + vector)

Streaming LLM responses

PDF highlighting for answers
